## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Buying Standard (1") Plates
Always buy Olympic (2") plates. Standard plates limit your options and have poor resale value.

### 2. Buying Only 45s
You need smaller plates for progressive overload. Don't skip 25s, 10s, and 5s.

### 3. Mixing Plate Types Poorly
Iron and bumpers can mix, but understand the implications for bar height and dropping.

### 4. Skipping Change Plates
2.5 lb plates are essential for progression. Don't skip them.

### 5. Buying Cheap Bumpers
Cheap bumpers wear out quickly. Buy quality once or iron plates instead.

### 6. Not Considering Resale
Quality plates hold 60-80% of value. Cheap plates are worthless used.

### 7. Buying Too Many at Once
Start with basics, add as you get stronger. Don't buy 600 lbs if you squat 135.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Should I buy iron or bumper plates?
**Iron if:** Budget-focused, traditional lifting, controlled environment
**Bumpers if:** Olympic lifting, CrossFit, want to drop weights, beginners

### Can I mix iron and bumper plates?
Yes, but bumpers should be on the inside (closest to collar) to protect them. Be aware of different diameters affecting bar height.

### How much weight do I need?
Start with 255 lbs total. Add more as you get stronger. Most people eventually need 400-600 lbs.

### Are expensive plates worth it?
For bumpers, yes—quality matters for durability. For iron, mid-range is fine. Competition plates are overkill for most.

### What about used plates?
Iron plates are great used (check for rust). Bumpers can be good if not heavily worn. Avoid cracked or severely damaged plates.

### Do I need calibrated plates?
No, unless you're a competitive powerlifter. Standard plates are accurate enough (±2-3%).
