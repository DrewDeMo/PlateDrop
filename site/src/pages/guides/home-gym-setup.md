- Missing parts

### Timing Your Purchases

**Best Times to Buy:**
- **Black Friday/Cyber Monday:** 15-30% off
- **New Year:** January sales
- **Memorial Day/July 4th:** Summer sales
- **End of month:** Sales quotas
- **Used market:** January (New Year's resolution failures)

**Avoid:**
- January (highest prices on new equipment)
- Right before summer (demand spike)

## Setting Up Your Gym

- Verify level and square

**4. Arrange Equipment**

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Buying Too Much Too Soon
Start with essentials, add as needed. Many people buy equipment they never use.

### 2. Skimping on Flooring
Proper flooring protects your investment and reduces noise. Don't skip it.

### 3. Wrong Equipment for Space
Measure twice, buy once. Ensure equipment fits with room to move.

### 4. Ignoring Resale Value
Buy quality brands that hold value. You may upgrade or move eventually.

### 5. No Planning
Sketch your layout before buying. Consider workflow and safety.

### 6. Buying Based on Price Alone
Cheap equipment often needs replacement. Quality lasts decades.

### 7. Neglecting Lighting and Ventilation
Good lighting prevents injury. Ventilation makes training comfortable.

### 8. No Maintenance Plan
Equipment needs care. Set up a simple maintenance routine.
