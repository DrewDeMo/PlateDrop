## Workout Overview

**Duration:** 45-60 minutes
**Difficulty:** Beginner
**Focus:** Full body strength
**Frequency:** 3 times per week

This beginner strength program uses a simple but effective 5x5 structure. You'll perform five sets of five reps for each exercise, focusing on gradual weight progression.

## Warm-Up (5-10 minutes)

Warming up raises body temperature and prepares your muscles for the workout ahead.

1. **March in Place** - 2 minutes
   - Lift knees high and swing your arms
2. **Shoulder Circles** - 20 reps each direction
   - Keep your arms relaxed and make large circles
3. **Bodyweight Squats** - 15 reps
   - Try to squat as deep as you can while maintaining balance

## Main Workout

### Exercise 1: [Barbell Squat](/guides/barbells)

**Sets:** 5 | **Reps:** 5 | **Rest:** 90 seconds

The barbell squat is a full-body exercise that targets the lower body and core. Remember to keep your back straight and chest up.

**Form Tips:**
- Push your knees outwards during the ascent
- Keep your eyes forward, not down
- Engage your core throughout the movement

Continue this format for Bench Press, Overhead Press, Deadlift, and Bent Over Rows.

## Cool-Down (5-10 minutes)

Cooling down helps your body return to its normal state and reduces muscle stiffness.

1. **Hamstring Stretch** - 30 seconds each leg
   - Keep your back straight and reach for your toes
2. **Quad Stretch** - 30 seconds each leg
   - Grab your ankle and pull it towards your butt 
3. **Arm Across Chest Stretch** - 30 seconds each arm
   - Pull the arm across the chest, just below the elbow

## Progression Tips

Start with light weights to focus on proper form. Gradually increase as you get stronger.

**Week 1-2:** Use bare barbell for form practice.
**Week 3-4:** Add small weight increments.
**Week 5+:** Increase weight only if you can lift with good form.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Skipping Warm-Up or Cool-Down** - These are essential for preventing injury and aiding recovery.
2. **Rushing The Reps** - Slow, controlled movements are key for muscle growth and strength.
3. **Ignoring Form** - Poor form can lead to injuries and ineffective workouts.

## Workout Variations

**If you have limited equipment:**
Substitute bodyweight exercises or dumbbell variations.

**If you want more intensity:**
Add accessory exercises or increase the weight.

**If you're short on time:**
Focus on compound movements like squats, bench press, and deadlifts.

## Nutrition and Recovery Tips

Proper nutrition is key for muscle growth. Aim for a balanced diet rich in lean protein, complex carbs, and healthy fats. Donâ€™t forget to hydrate and get plenty of rest!

## Tracking Your Progress

Track the weights you lift each week. As you get stronger, you should see these numbers gradually increase.

## Final Thoughts

This 5x5 workout is a great foundation for building strength in your home gym. Stay consistent, focus on form, and watch your progress soar!
