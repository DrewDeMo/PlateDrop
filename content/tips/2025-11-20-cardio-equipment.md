# Best Cardio Equipment for Home Gyms

When setting up a home gym, finding the right cardio equipment can be a challenge. This guide helps you navigate through the choices, focusing on two popular options - the assault bike and rowing machine.

## Why This Matters

Cardio exercise is crucial for overall health and fitness. Choosing the right equipment can maximize your workout efficiency and keep you motivated.

## The Basics

Cardio equipment varies in movement type, intensity level, and space requirements.

**Key Points:**
- An assault bike offers full-body workout with adjustable resistance
- A rowing machine provides low-impact cardio that strengthens upper body and core
- Both require different space considerations and maintenance routines

## Comparing Assault Bikes and Rowing Machines

Let's compare these two options in detail.

### Option 1: Assault Bike

**Pros:**

- Adjustable resistance
- High calorie burn

**Cons:**

- Requires more space than rowers

**Best for:** Those seeking intense workouts and have adequate space

### Option 2: Rowing Machine

**Pros:**
- Total body workout

**Best for:** Those with limited space or prefer low-impact cardio
